## Introducing Overwatch: Your Comprehensive Financial Overview Tool

The Overwatch SPA is designed to offer users a streamlined and insightful view of their financial transactions, enabling better financial management and oversight. This powerful tool provides a detailed summary of incoming and outgoing funds and allows you to track your accumulated balance over time. Here's how to get started and make the most of the Overwatch Extension:

---

## Accessing Overwatch

- **Sharable Link**: The Overwatch Extension is accessible via a sharable link, meaning you can open it on any device with a browser. This makes it incredibly convenient to check your financial overview on the go, whether you're using a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer.

---

## Features & Functionalities

- **Transaction Overview**: Get a clear picture of all your transactions in one place. Overwatch allows you to see every incoming and outgoing transaction, providing you with a comprehensive view of your financial activity.

- **Filter & Search**: Tailor your transaction view by using filters such as date and name, or utilize the free search function to quickly find specific transactions. This feature ensures that you can always find the information you need without having to sift through irrelevant data.

- **Accumulated Balance**: Overwatch gives you an up-to-date overview of your accumulated balance, allowing you to track your financial health over time. This is particularly useful for budgeting and financial planning purposes.

- **Export TX Reports**: Prepare for tax season without the hassle. Overwatch enables you to export tramsaction reports in CSV format.

## Exporting Reports

1. **Select Report Type**: Reports are available in CSV format for easy use and compatibility.
2. **Choose Time Frame**: Specify the period for the report you wish to download—select from a specific month, the whole year, or all transactions.
3. **Download**: Once you've made your selections, simply download the report for your records.

---

## Limitations

It's important to note that the Overwatch Extension is designed for overview purposes only. While you can view all transactions and financial summaries, the extension does not support the ability to send funds. This ensures that your overview is a secure and efficient tool for financial management without the risk associated with transactional capabilities.

**Addable Feature**:
Already created LNbits TPoS can be included. This enables **Overwatch** to transform into an accounting and invoicing tool.

## Approaches to Expansion for the Future

- Visualizing the wallet performance with easy-to-read graphs and pie charts (No Overload - Keep it clean).

- Option to visualize specified products only (Listed products by LNbits TPoS or external pay Plugins for WooCommerce, Shopify, etc.). This would open new information input for products which could perhaps be advertised in a specified timeslot, fulfilling a marketing aspect.

- Choice of different user interface colors, which should be user-specific and cached in the browser.

- Add CSV DATEV record structure: [DATEV Developer Platform](https://developer.datev.de/datev/platform/en/dtvf).

## Addressed for Main Use

- **Merchants & eCommerce**

- **However, it is also suited for individual users.**
